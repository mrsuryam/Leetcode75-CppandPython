## [Number of Provinces](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-provinces/description/)

Complexity: Medium 
Tags: Graphs, Depth-First-Search 


# Question

There are n cities. Some of them are connected, while some are not. If city a is connected directly with city b, and city b is connected directly with city c, then city a is connected indirectly with city c.

A province is a group of directly or indirectly connected cities and no other cities outside of the group.

You are given an n x n matrix isConnected where isConnected[i][j] = 1 if the ith city and the jth city are directly connected, and isConnected[i][j] = 0 otherwise.

Return the total number of provinces.
 
# Examples

Example 1:


Input: isConnected = [[1,1,0],[1,1,0],[0,0,1]]
Output: 2
Example 2:


Input: isConnected = [[1,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,1]]
Output: 3

## Solution in cpp

```
class Solution {
public:
    int findCircleNum(std::vector<std::vector<int>>& isConnected) {
        // Get the number of cities (nodes).
        int cities = isConnected.size();
      
        // Initialize the count of provinces (initially no connection is found).
        int provinceCount = 0;
      
        // Visited array to keep track of the visited cities.
        bool visited[cities];
      
        // Initialize all cities as unvisited.
        std::memset(visited, false, sizeof(visited));
      
        // Define depth-first search (DFS) as a lambda function.
        std::function<void(int)> dfs = [&](int cityIndex) {
            // Mark the current city as visited.
            visited[cityIndex] = true;
          
            // Visit all the cities connected to the current city.
            for (int j = 0; j < cities; ++j) {
                // If the city is not visited and is connected, perform DFS on it.
                if (!visited[j] && isConnected[cityIndex][j]) {
                    dfs(j);
                }
            }
        };
      
        // Iterate over each city to count the number of provinces.
        for (int i = 0; i < cities; ++i) {
            // If the city is not yet visited, it is part of a new province.
            if (!visited[i]) {
                dfs(i); // Perform DFS to visit all cities in the current province.
                ++provinceCount; // Increment the count of provinces.
            }
        }
      
        // Return the total number of provinces found.
        return provinceCount;
    }
};
```

## Solution in Python
```
class Solution:
    def findCircleNum(self, isConnected: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        # Depth-First Search function which marks the nodes as visited
        def dfs(current_city: int):
            visited[current_city] = True  # Mark the current city as visited
            for adjacent_city, connected in enumerate(isConnected[current_city]):
                # If the adjacent city is not visited and there is a connection,
                # then continue the search from that city
                if not visited[adjacent_city] and connected:
                    dfs(adjacent_city)

        # Number of cities in the given matrix
        num_cities = len(isConnected)
        # Initialize a visited list to keep track of cities that have been visited
        visited = [False] * num_cities
        # Counter for the number of provinces (disconnected components)
        province_count = 0
        # Loop over each city and perform DFS if it hasn't been visited
        for city in range(num_cities):
            if not visited[city]:  # If the city hasn't been visited yet
                dfs(city)  # Start DFS from this city
                # After finishing DFS, we have found a new province
                province_count += 1
        # Return the total number of disconnected components (provinces) in the graph
        return province_count
