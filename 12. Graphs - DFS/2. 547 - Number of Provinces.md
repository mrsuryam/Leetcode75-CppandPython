# Question

There are n cities. Some of them are connected, while some are not. If city a is connected directly with city b, and city b is connected directly with city c, then city a is connected indirectly with city c.

A province is a group of directly or indirectly connected cities and no other cities outside of the group.

You are given an n x n matrix isConnected where isConnected[i][j] = 1 if the ith city and the jth city are directly connected, and isConnected[i][j] = 0 otherwise.

Return the total number of provinces.
 
# Examples

Example 1:

Input: isConnected = [[1,1,0],[1,1,0],[0,0,1]]
Output: 2

Example 2:

Input: isConnected = [[1,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,1]]
Output: 3

## Explanation

To find the solution, we conceptualize the cities and the connections between them as a graph, where each city is a node and each direct connection is an edge. Now, the problem translates to finding the number of connected components in the graph. Each connected component will represent one province.

To do this, we use Depth-First Search (DFS). Here's the intuition behind using DFS:

    We start with the first city and perform a DFS to mark all cities that are connected directly or indirectly to it. These cities form one province.
    Once the DFS is completed, we look for the next city that hasn't been visited yet and perform a DFS from that city to find another province.
    We repeat this process until all cities have been visited.
    Each time we initiate a DFS from a new unvisited city, we know that we've found a new province, so we increment our province count. The DFS ensures that we navigate through all the cities within a province before moving on to the next one.

By doing the above steps using a vis (visited) list to keep track of which cities have been visited, we can effectively determine and count all the provinces.

## Algorithm

1. Define a recursive function dfs(i: int) that will perform a depth-first search starting from city i.
2. Inside the dfs function, mark the current city i as visited by setting vis[i] to True.
3. Iterate over all cities using j (which correspond to the columns of isConnected[i]).
4. For each city j, check if j has not been visited (not vis[j]) and is directly connected to i (isConnected[i][j] == 1).
5. If that's the case, call dfs(j) to visit all cities connected to j, marking the entire connected component as visited.

The solution then follows these steps using the vis list:

6. Initialize the vis list to be of the same length as the number of cities (n), with all elements set to False, indicating that no cities have been visited yet.
7. Initialize a counter ans to 0, which will hold the number of provinces found.
8. Iterate through all cities i from 0 to n - 1.
9. For each city i, check if it has not been visited yet (not vis[i]).
10. If it hasn't, it means we've encountered a new province. Call dfs(i) to mark all cities within this new province as visited.
11. Increment the ans counter by 1 as we have found a new province.
12. Continue the loop until all cities have been visited and all provinces have been counted.

## Solution in cpp

```
class Solution {
public:
    int findCircleNum(std::vector<std::vector<int>>& isConnected) {
        // Get the number of cities (nodes).
        int cities = isConnected.size();
      
        // Initialize the count of provinces (initially no connection is found).
        int provinceCount = 0;
      
        // Visited array to keep track of the visited cities.
        bool visited[cities];
      
        // Initialize all cities as unvisited.
        std::memset(visited, false, sizeof(visited));
      
        // Define depth-first search (DFS) as a lambda function.
        std::function<void(int)> dfs = [&](int cityIndex) {
            // Mark the current city as visited.
            visited[cityIndex] = true;
          
            // Visit all the cities connected to the current city.
            for (int j = 0; j < cities; ++j) {
                // If the city is not visited and is connected, perform DFS on it.
                if (!visited[j] && isConnected[cityIndex][j]) {
                    dfs(j);
                }
            }
        };
      
        // Iterate over each city to count the number of provinces.
        for (int i = 0; i < cities; ++i) {
            // If the city is not yet visited, it is part of a new province.
            if (!visited[i]) {
                dfs(i); // Perform DFS to visit all cities in the current province.
                ++provinceCount; // Increment the count of provinces.
            }
        }
      
        // Return the total number of provinces found.
        return provinceCount;
    }
};
```

## Solution in Python
```
class Solution:
    def findCircleNum(self, isConnected: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        # Depth-First Search function which marks the nodes as visited
        def dfs(current_city: int):
            visited[current_city] = True  # Mark the current city as visited
            for adjacent_city, connected in enumerate(isConnected[current_city]):
                # If the adjacent city is not visited and there is a connection,
                # then continue the search from that city
                if not visited[adjacent_city] and connected:
                    dfs(adjacent_city)

        # Number of cities in the given matrix
        num_cities = len(isConnected)
        # Initialize a visited list to keep track of cities that have been visited
        visited = [False] * num_cities
        # Counter for the number of provinces (disconnected components)
        province_count = 0
        # Loop over each city and perform DFS if it hasn't been visited
        for city in range(num_cities):
            if not visited[city]:  # If the city hasn't been visited yet
                dfs(city)  # Start DFS from this city
                # After finishing DFS, we have found a new province
                province_count += 1
        # Return the total number of disconnected components (provinces) in the graph
        return province_count
```
