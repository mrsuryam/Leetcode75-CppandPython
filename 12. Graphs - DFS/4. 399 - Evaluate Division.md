# Question

You are given an array of variable pairs equations and an array of real numbers values, where `equations[i] = [Ai, Bi]` and values[i] represent the equation Ai / Bi = values[i]. Each Ai or Bi is a string that represents a single variable.

You are also given some queries, where `queries[j] = [Cj, Dj]` represents the jth query where you must find the answer for `Cj / Dj = ?`.

Return the answers to all queries. If a single answer cannot be determined, return -1.0.
Note: The input is always valid. You may assume that evaluating the queries will not result in division by zero and that there is no contradiction.
Note: The variables that do not occur in the list of equations are undefined, so the answer cannot be determined for them.
 
# Examples

Example 1:

Input: equations = [["a","b"],["b","c"]], values = [2.0,3.0], queries = [["a","c"],["b","a"],["a","e"],["a","a"],["x","x"]]
Output: [6.00000,0.50000,-1.00000,1.00000,-1.00000]
Explanation: 
Given: a / b = 2.0, b / c = 3.0
queries are: a / c = ?, b / a = ?, a / e = ?, a / a = ?, x / x = ? 
return: [6.0, 0.5, -1.0, 1.0, -1.0 ]
note: x is undefined => -1.0

Example 2:

Input: equations = [["a","b"],["b","c"],["bc","cd"]], values = [1.5,2.5,5.0], queries = [["a","c"],["c","b"],["bc","cd"],["cd","bc"]]
Output: [3.75000,0.40000,5.00000,0.20000]

Example 3:

Input: equations = [["a","b"]], values = [0.5], queries = [["a","b"],["b","a"],["a","c"],["x","y"]]
Output: [0.50000,2.00000,-1.00000,-1.00000]

## Explanation

The intuition behind solving this problem lies in recognizing it as a graph problem. Each variable can be thought of as a node in a graph, and each equation as an edge that connects two variables. The value associated with each equation is the weight of the corresponding edge.

Using this interpretation, the problem of finding the ratio of two variables becomes a problem of finding a path between two nodes in the graph. If there's a direct path between the nodes (variables) representing the numerator and denominator, we can calculate the result; if not, or if one of the variables doesn't exist in the graph, the result is -1.0.

To efficiently find the connections and calculate the ratios between variables, we can use the Union-Find algorithm, which is suitable for handling such dynamic connectivity problems. It helps track which variables are connected and combines groups of connected components efficiently.

## Algorithm

1. We initialize two dictionaries w and p. w holds the relative weight of a variable to its root, and p holds the parent (or root representative) of each variable.
2. We iterate over the list of equations to set up the initial connections. Each variable is initially set as a root of itself.
3. As we go through the values alongside equations, we find the root representatives of a and b (pa and pb respectively). If they are already connected (i.e., have the same root), we skip to the next equation.
4. If they are not connected, we connect them by setting the parent of pa to be pb and adjusting the weight of pa to maintain the correct ratio as given by the current equation. The weight of pa is updated to be the weight of b times the given value divided by the weight of a. This ensures that the weight reflects the ratio between these two connected components up to their common root.

Once the equations are processed and the Union-Find structure is ready, we handle the queries:

1. For each queries pair (c, d), we check if c or d are not present in the p dictionary. If either is not present, it means we cannot determine the ratio and hence return -1.
2. If c and d are present, we perform find operations on both to get their root representatives.
3. If they have different roots, the variables are in different disjoint sets, and we cannot determine their ratio, so we return -1.
4. If c and d belong to the same connected component (have the same root), we return the ratio by dividing w[c] by w[d]. This works because w[c] represents the ratio of c to its root and w[d] of d to that same root, so their division gives the ratio c/d.
