# Question

There are n cities numbered from `0` to `n - 1` and `n - 1` roads such that there is only one way to travel between two different cities (this network form a tree). Last year, The ministry of transport decided to orient the roads in one direction because they are too narrow.

Roads are represented by connections where `connections[i] = [ai, bi]` represents a road from city ai to city bi.

This year, there will be a big event in the capital `(city 0)`, and many people want to travel to this city.
Your task consists of reorienting some roads such that each city can visit the city 0. Return the minimum number of edges changed.
It's guaranteed that each city can reach city 0 after reorder.
 
# Examples

Example 1:

Input: n = 6, connections = [[0,1],[1,3],[2,3],[4,0],[4,5]]
Output: 3
Explanation: Change the direction of edges show in red such that each node can reach the node 0 (capital).

Example 2:

Input: n = 5, connections = [[1,0],[1,2],[3,2],[3,4]]
Output: 2
Explanation: Change the direction of edges show in red such that each node can reach the node 0 (capital).

Example 3:

Input: n = 3, connections = [[1,0],[2,0]]
Output: 0

## Explanation

The underlying concept of the solution is Depth-First Search (DFS). We employ DFS because it effectively explores all the paths from the root to the leaves in a tree, which aligns well with the nature of our problem — ensuring connectivity in a tree from every node to the root.

To solve the problem, we treat the graph as undirected to explore it freely. However, we have to remember the initial direction of the roads. Consequently, as we perform DFS starting from the capital city (node 0), we keep a set of tuples s representing the original direction of the roads.

When we traverse from one city to another, we check if we are moving in the direction originally set for the road. If we are not, this means that to achieve our goal of reorienting roads toward the capital, we will have to change the direction of this road. Thus, we increment our counter of changed roads each time we travel on a road in the direction it was not initially intended for.

The process is recursive — from each city we visit, we attempt to visit all other cities it is connected to (that we have not already visited), keeping track of the roads we need to change. The base effective case for the recursive DFS is when we have visited all cities. The sum of changed roads then gives us the minimum number of changes required to meet our goal of connectivity to the capital.

## Algorithm

1. Initializing the Graph: Here we initialize g as a default dictionary of lists, which will store the undirected graph.

2. Storing Original Direction: For each connection in the input, we add an edge to our graph in both directions (to make it undirected), and the original direction (from a to b) is stored in set s.

3. Visitation Tracking: An array vis of boolean values is used to keep track of visited cities.

4. Depth-First Search (DFS): The dfs function is recursively applied to traverse the graph. If we encounter a city v that has not been visited and the original direction of the road was from u to v (stored in set s), we know that we need to change this road's direction.

5. Returning the Result: Finally, we start the DFS from the capital city, city 0, and the function returns the total number of road changes required to achieve the goal.

6. This approach ensures that we only consider each road once and return the minimum number of roads that need to be reoriented so that every city can travel to the capital.

## Solution in cpp

```
class Solution {
 public:
  int minReorder(int n, vector<vector<int>>& connections) {
    vector<vector<int>> graph(n);

    for (const vector<int>& connection : connections) {
      const int u = connection[0];
      const int v = connection[1];
      graph[u].push_back(v);
      graph[v].push_back(-u);  // - := u -> v
    }

    return dfs(graph, 0, -1);
  }

 private:
  int dfs(const vector<vector<int>>& graph, int u, int prev) {
    int change = 0;

    for (const int v : graph[u]) {
      if (abs(v) == prev)
        continue;
      if (v > 0)
        ++change;
      change += dfs(graph, abs(v), u);
    }

    return change;
  }
};
```

## Solution in Python
```
from collections import defaultdict

class Solution:
    def minReorder(self, n: int, connections: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        # Perform depth-first search to count reorders starting from node u.
        def dfs(node):
            visited[node] = True  # Mark the current node as visited.
            count = 0  # Initialize the reorder count.

            # Iterate over connected nodes of the current node.
            for connected_node in adjacency_list[node]:
                if not visited[connected_node]:
                    # If the edge from the current node to the connected node is in
                    # the original direction, increase the reorder count.
                    if (node, connected_node) in directed_edges:
                        count += 1
                    # Add the result of recursively calling dfs on the connected node.
                    count += dfs(connected_node)
            return count

        # Create an adjacency list and a set to store directed edges.
        adjacency_list = defaultdict(list)
        directed_edges = set()

        # Populate the adjacency list and directed edges set.
        for a, b in connections:
            adjacency_list[a].append(b)
            adjacency_list[b].append(a)
            directed_edges.add((a, b))

        # Initialize a list to keep track of visited nodes.
        visited = [False] * n

        # Start the depth-first search from node 0 and return the reorder count.
        return dfs(0)
```
