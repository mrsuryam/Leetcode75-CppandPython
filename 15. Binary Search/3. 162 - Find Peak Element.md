# Question

A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.

Given a 0-indexed integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.

You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -âˆž. In other words, an element is always considered to be strictly greater than a neighbor that is outside the array.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time..
 
# Examples

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: 3 is a peak element and your function should return the index number 2.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,2,1,3,5,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Your function can return either index number 1 where the peak element is 2, or index number 5 where the peak element is 6.

## Explanation

Take two pointers, both at the start of the array, find the first occurance of non-zero and replace it with first pointer element. 
increment both the pointers, once you are reach end of array with one pointer, put all zeroes.

## Algorithm

1. Take two pointers, one for starting and the other one at the end of string. 
2. while ( first <= end), check for the chars for vowels. 
3. If both are not vowels, increment first pointer and decrement last pointer. 
4. If one of them are vowels, increment/decrement the other one. 
5. If both are vowels, then swap the characters. 
8. Return the string.


## Solution in cpp
```
class Solution {
public:
    int findPeakElement(vector<int>& nums) {
        int left = 0, right = nums.size() - 1;
        while (left < right) {
            int mid = ( left + right ) / 2;
            if (nums[mid] > nums[mid + 1]) {
                right = mid;
            } else {
                left = mid + 1;
            }
        }
        return left; 
    }
};
```
