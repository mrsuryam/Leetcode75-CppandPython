# Question

Koko loves to eat bananas. There are `n` piles of bananas, the ith pile has `piles[i]` bananas. The guards have gone and will come back in `h` hours.

Koko can decide her bananas-per-hour eating speed of k. Each hour, she chooses some pile of bananas and eats k bananas from that pile. If the pile has less than k bananas, she eats all of them instead and will not eat any more bananas during this hour.

Koko likes to eat slowly but still wants to finish eating all the bananas before the guards return.

Return the minimum integer k such that she can eat all the bananas within h hours.
 
# Examples

Example 1:

Input: piles = [3,6,7,11], h = 8
Output: 4

Example 2:

Input: piles = [30,11,23,4,20], h = 5
Output: 30

Example 3:

Input: piles = [30,11,23,4,20], h = 6
Output: 23

## Explanation

The solution is based on a binary search approach. Since we're looking for the minimum integer value of k that enables Koko to finish all bananas within h hours, and k can range from 1 (eating very slowly) to the maximum number of bananas in any pile in the worst-case scenario (eating very fast), we can use binary search to narrow down the possible values of k.

We start with the lower bound left of 1 (the slowest possible eating speed) and an upper bound right which is set to a high enough value (like 10^9) that it's guaranteed to be higher than the maximum necessary speed.

At each step of the binary search, we calculate the midpoint mid between left and right. We then calculate the total hours s it would take for Koko to eat all the bananas at this speed. If s is less than or equal to h, this means mid is a viable eating speed and could possibly be the answer, so we move the right bound to mid, potentially reducing the range. If s is greater than h, then eating at speed mid is too slow and we need to increase the eating speed, so we move the left bound up to mid + 1.

The binary search continues until left and right converge to the minimum possible value of k that allows Koko to eat all bananas in h hours.

## Algorithm

1. Initialize two pointers: one for the lower bound left set to 1 (since Koko has to eat at least one banana per hour), and another for the upper bound right set to a large number, such as 10^9, to ensure that it is larger than any real-world scenario would require.

2. While left is less than right, we continue the binary search:
    We find the midpoint mid by averaging the left and right pointers ((left + right) >> 1). Here, the >> 1 operation is a bitwise shift that effectively divides the sum by two.

    We then compute the total number of hours s it would take to eat all the piles at the eating speed mid. This is done by iterating over each pile in piles and calculating the hours needed for each pile using (x + mid - 1) // mid, which is a way to perform ceiling division without using floats to ensure we get an integer result. This formula accounts for the fact that if there are less than mid bananas in a pile, Koko will spend an entire hour eating it (represented by the x + mid - 1 part).

3. After calculating s, we make a decision based on whether this proposed eating speed mid is fast enough:

    If s is less than or equal to h, we know that mid is at least as fast as the eating speed needs to be, so we adjust the upper bound right to mid. This narrows the search and potentially lowers the eating speed.

    If s is greater than h, the proposed eating speed mid is too slow, and we need to look for a faster eating speed; thus, we move the lower bound left up to mid + 1.

4. The binary search ends when left equals right, at which point left represents the minimum integer eating speed k that allows Koko to eat all bananas within h hours.

## Solution in cpp
```
class Solution {
public:
    int minEatingSpeed(vector<int>& piles, int h) {
        int l = 1, r = ranges::max(piles);
        while (l < r) {
            int mid = (l + r) >> 1;
            int s = 0;
            for (int x : piles) {
                s += (x + mid - 1) / mid;
            }
            if (s <= h) {
                r = mid;
            } else {
                l = mid + 1;
            }
        }
        return l;
    }
};
```

## Solution in Python
```
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def minEatingSpeed(self, piles: List[int], hours: int) -> int:
        # Initialize the search space for Koko's possible eating speed
        # left represents the minimum possible eating speed
        # right represents the maximum possible eating speed which we initialize to 1e9
        left, right = 1, int(1e9)
      
        # Use binary search to find the minimum eating speed
        while left < right:
            # Calculate the middle point of the current search space
            # Equivalent to (left + right) // 2 but avoids possible overflow in other languages
            mid = (left + right) >> 1
          
            # Calculate total hours needed to eat all piles at this eating speed
            total_hours = sum((pile + mid - 1) // mid for pile in piles)
          
            # If Koko can eat all bananas within the given hours at this speed,
            # update the upper bound of the search space
            if total_hours <= hours:
                right = mid
            else:
                # Otherwise, this speed is too slow, update the lower bound
                left = mid + 1
              
        # The left pointer will be at the minimum eating speed at which Koko can
        # eat all the bananas within the given hours
        return left
```
