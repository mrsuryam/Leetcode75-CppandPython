# Question

You are given an m x n grid where each cell can have one of three values:

0 representing an empty cell,
1 representing a fresh orange, or
2 representing a rotten orange.
Every minute, any fresh orange that is 4-directionally adjacent to a rotten orange becomes rotten.

Return the minimum number of minutes that must elapse until no cell has a fresh orange. If this is impossible, return -1.
 
# Examples

Example 1:

Input: grid = [[2,1,1],[1,1,0],[0,1,1]]
Output: 4

Example 2:

Input: grid = [[2,1,1],[0,1,1],[1,0,1]]
Output: -1
Explanation: The orange in the bottom left corner (row 2, column 0) is never rotten, because rotting only happens 4-directionally.

Example 3:

Input: grid = [[0,2]]
Output: 0
Explanation: Since there are already no fresh oranges at minute 0, the answer is just 0

## Explanation

The intuition behind the solution is to use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) approach, which is well-suited for problems involving levels or minutes passing by as in this case. We can think of each minute as a level in a BFS traversal.

The process begins by scanning the grid to do two things:

  Identify and enqueue all the initially rotten oranges (cells with a value 2), as these will be the starting points for the spread of rot, and
  Count the amount of fresh oranges (cells with a value 1) because we need to keep track of when no fresh oranges are left.

## Algorithm

1. The implementation of the solution starts by initializing some basic variables:

  m, n to store the dimensions of the grid.
  q, a double-ended queue (deque), which is used to perform efficient pop and append operations from both ends, crucial for BFS.
  cnt to keep a count of the fresh oranges.
  Next, we iterate through the grid to fill our queue q with the initial positions of the rotten oranges and count the number of fresh oranges using cnt. This setup phase is necessary to kickstart the BFS process.

2. Now, we define a variable ans to keep track of the time taken in minutes. We execute a loop that continues as long as there are fresh oranges (cnt) and there are rotten oranges in the queue to process (q). Each iteration of the loop represents a passing minute where potential rotting of adjacent oranges occurs.

3. Inside the loop, we increment ans for each round of minute and process all rotten oranges in the queue for that minute:

4. Pop each position of a rotten orange from the front of the queue.
Look at each of the four adjacent cells using the provided direction vectors [[0, 1], [0, -1], [1, 0], [-1, 0]].
For each adjacent cell:
  Calculate the new coordinates x and y based on the current position i, j and the direction vector a, b.
  Check if the adjacent cell is within the grid bounds and if it contains a fresh orange (grid[x][y] == 1).
  If the adjacent cell is a fresh orange, decrement cnt, set that cell to 2 (rotten), and append its position to the queue q for processing in the next minute.
  Once the BFS loop ends, we check whether there are any fresh oranges left untouched (cnt > 0). If there are, we return -1, indicating that it's impossible to rot all oranges. If cnt is 0, meaning all fresh oranges have been turned rotten, we return ans, the total minutes elapsed.

5. The use of BFS ensures that we process all oranges that could potentially become rotten in a particular minute before moving on to the next minute. This closely emulates the passage of time and the spread of rot from orange to orange. The deque data structure allows us to efficiently enqueue new rotten oranges for subsequent processing while still keeping track of the current round of oranges being processed.

## Solution in cpp
```
class Solution {
 public:
  int orangesRotting(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
    constexpr int dirs[4][2] = {{0, 1}, {1, 0}, {0, -1}, {-1, 0}};
    const int m = grid.size();
    const int n = grid[0].size();

    auto isNeighborRotten = [&](int i, int j, const vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
      for (const auto& [dx, dy] : dirs) {
        const int r = i + dx;
        const int c = j + dy;
        if (r < 0 || r == m || c < 0 || c == n)
          continue;
        if (grid[r][c] == 2)
          return true;
      }
      return false;
    };

    int ans = 0;

    while (true) {
      vector<vector<int>> nextGrid(m, vector<int>(n));
      // Calculate `nextGrid` based on `grid`.
      for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i)
        for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j)
          if (grid[i][j] == 1) {  // fresh
            // Any of the 4-directionally oranges is rotten
            if (isNeighborRotten(i, j, grid))
              nextGrid[i][j] = 2;
            else
              nextGrid[i][j] = 1;
          } else if (grid[i][j] == 2) {  // rotten
            nextGrid[i][j] = 2;          // Keep rotten.
          }
      if (nextGrid == grid)
        break;
      grid = nextGrid;
      ++ans;
    }

    return any_of(grid.begin(), grid.end(),
                  [&](vector<int>& row) {
      return ranges::any_of(row, [&](int orange) { return orange == 1; });
    })
               ? -1
               : ans;
  }
};
```

        for i in range(rows):
            for j in range(cols):

                if grid[i][j] == 2:
                    queue.append((i, j))
                # If it's a fresh orange, increment the fresh_count.
                elif grid[i][j] == 1:
                    fresh_count += 1
      
        # Track the number of minutes passed.
        minutes_passed = 0
      
        # Perform BFS until the queue is empty or there are no fresh oranges left.
        while queue and fresh_count > 0:
            # Increment minutes each time we start a new round of BFS.
            minutes_passed += 1
          
            # Loop over all the rotten oranges at the current minute.
            for _ in range(len(queue)):
                i, j = queue.popleft()

                for delta_row, delta_col in [[0, 1], [0, -1], [1, 0], [-1, 0]]:
                    x, y = i + delta_row, j + delta_col
                  
                    # If the adjacent cell has a fresh orange, rot it.
                    if 0 <= x < rows and 0 <= y < cols and grid[x][y] == 1:
                        fresh_count -= 1
                        grid[x][y] = 2
                        queue.append((x, y))
      
        # If there are no fresh oranges left, return the minutes passed.
        # Otherwise, return -1 because some oranges will never rot.
        return minutes_passed if fresh_count == 0 else -1
