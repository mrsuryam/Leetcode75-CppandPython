# Question

You are given an `m x n` matrix maze (0-indexed) with empty cells (represented as '.') and walls (represented as '+'). You are also given the entrance of the maze, where entrance = [entrancerow, entrancecol] denotes the row and column of the cell you are initially standing at.

In one step, you can move one cell up, down, left, or right. You cannot step into a cell with a wall, and you cannot step outside the maze. Your goal is to find the nearest exit from the entrance. An exit is defined as an empty cell that is at the border of the maze. The entrance does not count as an exit.

Return the number of steps in the shortest path from the entrance to the nearest exit, or -1 if no such path exists.
 
# Examples

Example 1:

Input: maze = [["+","+",".","+"],[".",".",".","+"],["+","+","+","."]], entrance = [1,2]
Output: 1
Explanation: There are 3 exits in this maze at [1,0], [0,2], and [2,3].
Initially, you are at the entrance cell [1,2].
- You can reach [1,0] by moving 2 steps left.
- You can reach [0,2] by moving 1 step up.
It is impossible to reach [2,3] from the entrance.
Thus, the nearest exit is [0,2], which is 1 step away.

Example 2:

Input: maze = [["+","+","+"],[".",".","."],["+","+","+"]], entrance = [1,0]
Output: 2
Explanation: There is 1 exit in this maze at [1,2].
[1,0] does not count as an exit since it is the entrance cell.
Initially, you are at the entrance cell [1,0].
- You can reach [1,2] by moving 2 steps right.
Thus, the nearest exit is [1,2], which is 2 steps away.

Example 3:

Input: maze = [[".","+"]], entrance = [0,0]
Output: -1
Explanation: There are no exits in this maze.

## Explanation

We initialize BFS from the entrance by marking it as visited (to avoid revisiting) and then iteratively exploring all four adjacent cells. If an adjacent cell is empty and within the maze bounds, we check if it's an exit. If it's an exit, we immediately return the current step count since it's the minimum. If it's not, we continue the BFS by adding the cell to the queue. Importantly, as we enqueue a cell, we mark it with a wall to avoid revisiting cells that are already considered, effectively reducing unnecessary calculations.

If the BFS completes without finding an exit, we conclude that no path exists, and we return -1, indicating failure to reach an exit.

## Algorithm

1. Queue (deque): A queue is used for the BFS traversal, which follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. This ensures that cells are explored in the order they are reached.

2. Visited Marking: When a cell is visited, it is marked by changing its value to '+'. This prevents the algorithm from re-visiting the same cell, which would otherwise lead to infinite loops and incorrect step count.

3. Direction Array: A simple 2D array [[0, -1], [0, 1], [-1, 0], [1, 0]] is used to represent the four possible moves from any cell (left, right, up, down).

4. Checking Exit Condition: An exit is an empty cell ('.') at the border of the maze. Whenever moving to a new cell, the algorithm checks if it is an exit by comparing its coordinates with the boundary of the maze.

5. Steps Counter: The variable ans is used to count the number of steps taken to reach an exit. It gets incremented at the start of processing each level, ensuring the correct step count when an exit is found.

## Solution in cpp
```
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int nearestExit(vector<vector<char>>& maze, vector<int>& entrance) {
        // Initialize the maze dimensions
        int rows = maze.size(), cols = maze[0].size();

        // Queue to store the path in (x, y) coordinates
        queue<vector<int>> queue{{entrance}};

        // Mark the entrance as visited
        maze[entrance[0]][entrance[1]] = '+';

        // Initialize the step counter
        int steps = 0;

        // Possible directions to move: up, right, down, left
        vector<int> directions = {-1, 0, 1, 0, -1};

        // Perform breadth-first search to find the nearest exit
        while (!queue.empty()) {
            // Increment the step counter at the start of each level of BFS
            ++steps;

            // Process all nodes on the current level
            for (int count = queue.size(); count > 0; --count) {
                // Get the current position
                auto position = queue.front();
                queue.pop();

                // Explore all possible directions from the current position
                for (int i = 0; i < 4; ++i) {
                    int x = position[0] + directions[i], y = position[1] + directions[i + 1];

                    // Check if the new position is within bounds and not visited
                    if (x >= 0 && x < rows && y >= 0 && y < cols && maze[x][y] == '.') {
                        // Check if the new position is an exit
                        if (x == 0 || x == rows - 1 || y == 0 || y == cols - 1) return steps;

                        // Add the new position to the queue and mark as visited
                        queue.push({x, y});
                        maze[x][y] = '+';
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        // Return -1 if no exit is found
        return -1;
    }
};
```

                    if 0 <= new_row < rows and 0 <= new_col < cols and maze[new_row][new_col] == '.':
                        # Check if the new position is on the edge of the maze, which means an exit is found
                        if new_row == 0 or new_row == rows - 1 or new_col == 0 or new_col == cols - 1:
                            return steps
                      
                        # Otherwise, add the position to the queue and mark as visited
                        queue.append((new_row, new_col))
                        maze[new_row][new_col] = '+'
