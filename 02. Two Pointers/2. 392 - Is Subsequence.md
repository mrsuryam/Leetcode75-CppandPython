# Question

Given two strings `s` and `t`, return `true` if s is a subsequence of t, or false otherwise.

A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).


# Examples

    Example 1:
    Input: s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"
    Output: true

    Example 2:
    Input: s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc"
    Output: false

## Explanation

we iterate through both strings concurrently from the beginning, using pointers. If a character in s matches a character in t, we move forward in both strings. If the characters don't match, we only move forward in t, since we're looking to delete or skip characters from t. When the end of s is reached, it signifies that all characters of s have been matched in t in order, proving that s is a subsequence of t.


## Algorithm

1. Loop through each character in string t and string s. 
2. If a character from s is present in t, 

## Solution in cpp
```
class Solution {
public:
    // time complexity => O(n)
    // Space complexity => O(1)
    // two pointer
    bool isSubsequence(string s, string t) {
        
        if (s.empty())
            return true;

        int i = 0;
        for (const char c : t) {
            if (s[i] == c)
              i++;
            // We reached end of string s.
            if (s.length() == i)
                return true;
        }

        return false;
    }
};
```

## Solution in Python
```
class Solution:
  def isSubsequence(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
    if not s:
      return True

    i = 0
    for c in t:
      if s[i] == c:
        i += 1
        if i == len(s):
          return True

    return False
```

Time Complexity: O(n) -> looping through the complete string from both ends. <br>
Space complexity: O(1) -> we are not creating any extra space.
