# Question

Given an input string s, reverse the order of the words.

A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The words in s will be separated by at least one space.

Return a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space.

Note that s may contain leading or trailing spaces or multiple spaces between two words. The returned string should only have a single space separating the words. Do not include any extra spaces.

# Examples

Example 1:

Input: s = "the sky is blue"
Output: "blue is sky the"

Example 2:

Input: s = "  hello world  "
Output: "world hello"
Explanation: Your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces.

Example 3:

Input: s = "a good   example"
Output: "example good a"
Explanation: You need to reduce multiple spaces between two words to a single space in the reversed string.
    

## Explanation

We would advance the pointers to find the beginning and end of each word, add that word to a list, and once we've gone through the whole string and captured all the words, we would reverse the list of words. We then join these words into a final result string with single spaces between them.

## Algorithm

1. Initialize i and j to the start of the string.
2. Increment j to find the end of a word, which is indicated by a space or the end of the string. 
3. Extract the word and add it to a result list. 
4. Reset i to j + 1 and find the next word.
5. After traversing the entire string and capturing all words into the result list, reverse the list.
6. Join the reverse list of words as in the first approach.


## Solution in cpp
```
class Solution {
 public:
  string reverseWords(string s) {
    ranges::reverse(s);                 // Reverse the whole string.
    reverseWords(s, s.length());        // Reverse each word.
    return cleanSpaces(s, s.length());  // Clean up the spaces.
  }

 private:
  void reverseWords(string& s, int n) {
    int i = 0;
    int j = 0;

    while (i < n) {
      while (i < j || i < n && s[i] == ' ')  // Skip the spaces.
        ++i;
      while (j < i || j < n && s[j] != ' ')  // Skip the spaces.
        ++j;
      reverse(s.begin() + i, s.begin() + j);  // Reverse the word.
    }
  }

  // Trim leading, trailing, and middle spaces
  string cleanSpaces(string& s, int n) {
    int i = 0;
    int j = 0;

    while (j < n) {
      while (j < n && s[j] == ' ')  // Skip the spaces.
        ++j;
      while (j < n && s[j] != ' ')  // Keep non spaces
        s[i++] = s[j++];
      while (j < n && s[j] == ' ')  // Skip the spaces.
        ++j;
      if (j < n)  // Keep only one space.
        s[i++] = ' ';
    }

    return s.substr(0, i);
  }
};
```

## Solution in Python
```
class Solution:
  def reverseWords(self, s: str) -> str:
    return ' '.join(reversed(s.split()))
```
Time Complexity: O(n) -> looping through the complete string from both ends.
Space complexity: O(n) -> we are creating an extra space of same string.
