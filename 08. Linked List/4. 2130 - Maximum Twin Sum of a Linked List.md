# Question

In a linked list of size n, where n is even, the ith node (0-indexed) of the linked list is known as the twin of the (n-1-i)th node, if  `0 <= i <= (n / 2) - 1`.

For example, if n = 4, then node 0 is the twin of node 3, and node 1 is the twin of node 2. These are the only nodes with twins for n = 4.
The twin sum is defined as the sum of a node and its twin.

Given the head of a linked list with even length, return the maximum twin sum of the linked list.

 
# Examples

Example 1:

Input: head = [5,4,2,1]
Output: 6
Explanation:
Nodes 0 and 1 are the twins of nodes 3 and 2, respectively. All have twin sum = 6.
There are no other nodes with twins in the linked list.
Thus, the maximum twin sum of the linked list is 6. 

Example 2:

Input: head = [4,2,2,3]
Output: 7
Explanation:
The nodes with twins present in this linked list are:
- Node 0 is the twin of node 3 having a twin sum of 4 + 3 = 7.
- Node 1 is the twin of node 2 having a twin sum of 2 + 2 = 4.
Thus, the maximum twin sum of the linked list is max(7, 4) = 7. 

Example 3:

Input: head = [1,100000]
Output: 100001
Explanation:
There is only one node with a twin in the linked list having twin sum of 1 + 100000 = 100001.
 

## Explanation

The challenge in this problem is to efficiently find the twin of each node so that we can calculate the twin sums. Since the list is singly linked, we cannot directly access the corresponding twin for a node in the first half of the list without traversing it.

An intuitive approach involves reversing the second half of the linked list so that we can then pair nodes from the first half and the reversed second half to calculate their sums. By iterating through the two halves simultaneously, we can easily calculate each twin sum and determine the maximum twin sum.

## Algorithm

1. Finding the Middle of the Linked List
2. Reversing the Second Half 
3. Calculating Maximum Twin Sum
4. Returning the Result:

## Solution in cpp
```
class Solution {
 public:
  int pairSum(ListNode* head) {
    int ans = 0;
    ListNode* slow = head;
    ListNode* fast = head;

    // `slow` points to the start of the second half.
    while (fast != nullptr && fast->next != nullptr) {
      slow = slow->next;
      fast = fast->next->next;
    }

    // `tail` points to the end of the reversed second half.
    ListNode* tail = reverseList(slow);

    while (tail != nullptr) {
      ans = max(ans, head->val + tail->val);
      head = head->next;
      tail = tail->next;
    }

    return ans;
  }

 private:
  ListNode* reverseList(ListNode* head) {
    ListNode* prev = nullptr;
    while (head != nullptr) {
      auto next = head->next;
      head->next = prev;
      prev = head;
      head = next;
    }
    return prev;
  }
};
```

## Solution in Python
```
class Solution:
  def pairSum(self, head: ListNode | None) -> int:
    def reverseList(head: ListNode) -> ListNode:
      prev = None
      while head:
        next = head.next
        head.next = prev
        prev = head
        head = next
      return prev

    ans = 0
    slow = head
    fast = head

    # `slow` points to the start of the second half.
    while fast and fast.next:
      slow = slow.next
      fast = fast.next.next

    # `tail` points to the end of the reversed second half.
    tail = reverseList(slow)

    while tail:
      ans = max(ans, head.val + tail.val)
      head = head.next
      tail = tail.next

    return ans
```

Space complexity: O(1) -> we are not creating any extra space.
