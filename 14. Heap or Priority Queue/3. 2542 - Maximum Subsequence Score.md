# Question

You are given two 0-indexed integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2` of equal length `n` and a positive integer `k`. You must choose a subsequence of indices from nums1 of length k.

For chosen indices i0, i1, ..., ik - 1, your score is defined as:

The sum of the selected elements from nums1 multiplied with the minimum of the selected elements from nums2.
It can defined simply as: (nums1[i0] + nums1[i1] +...+ nums1[ik - 1]) * min(nums2[i0] , nums2[i1], ... ,nums2[ik - 1]).
Return the maximum possible score.

A subsequence of indices of an array is a set that can be derived from the set {0, 1, ..., n-1} by deleting some or no elements.
 
# Examples

Example 1:

Input: nums1 = [1,3,3,2], nums2 = [2,1,3,4], k = 3
Output: 12
Explanation: 
The four possible subsequence scores are:
- We choose the indices 0, 1, and 2 with score = (1+3+3) * min(2,1,3) = 7.
- We choose the indices 0, 1, and 3 with score = (1+3+2) * min(2,1,4) = 6. 
- We choose the indices 0, 2, and 3 with score = (1+3+2) * min(2,3,4) = 12. 
- We choose the indices 1, 2, and 3 with score = (3+3+2) * min(1,3,4) = 8.
Therefore, we return the max score, which is 12.

Example 2:

Input: nums1 = [4,2,3,1,1], nums2 = [7,5,10,9,6], k = 1
Output: 30
Explanation: 
Choosing index 2 is optimal: nums1[2] * nums2[2] = 3 * 10 = 30 is the maximum possible score.

## Explanation

To maximize the score, we intuitively want to select the k indices that would result in the largest possible sum from nums1 while also ensuring that the minimum value selected from nums2 is as high as possible, because it multiplies the entire sum.

If we were just trying to maximize the sum of selected values from nums1, we would simply choose the k highest values. However, the challenge here is that we also need to consider nums2, as its minimum value among the chosen indices will act as a multiplier for our sum from nums1.

This leads to the strategy of pairing the elements from nums1 and nums2 and sorting these pairs in descending order based on the values from nums2, because we are interested in larger values of nums2 due to its role as a multiplier. Now, since our final score involves a sum from nums1 and a minimum from nums2, we wish to select the top k indices with respect to the product of sums and minimums.

To implement this, we keep a running sum of the nums1 values and use a min heap to keep track of the k smallest nums1 values that we have encountered. This is because, as we iterate through our sorted pairs, we want to have the ability to quickly identify and remove the smallest value from our current selection in order to replace it with a potentially better option. At each iteration, if our heap is full (i.e. has k elements), we calculate a possible score using our running sum and the current value from nums2. We update our maximum score if the newly calculated score exceeds our current maximum.

## Algorithm

1. Pairing and Sorting: We start by creating pairs (a, b) from nums2 and nums1, respectively. This allows us to process elements from both arrays simultaneously.
2. Min Heap Initialization: A min heap (q) is a data structure that allows us to efficiently keep track of the k smallest elements of nums1
3. Iterating Over Pairs: With our pairs sorted, we iterate over each (a, b). Variable a is from nums2 and b is from nums1.
4. Maintaining the Heap and Calculating Scores: In each iteration, we add b to the heap and to the running sum s. If the heap contains more than k elements, we remove the smallest element (which is at the root of the min heap). This ensures that our heap always contains the k largest elements from our current range of nums1 considered so far. We calculate the potential score by multiplying our running sum s with the minimum value from nums2 (which is a, because our pairs are sorted by the values from nums2 in descending order). We update the maximum score ans with this potential score if it's higher than the current ans.
5. Maximizing the Score: The heap's invariant, which always maintains the largest k elements from nums1 seen so far, guarantees that the running sum s is as large as it can be without considering the current pair's nums1 value, b. Since a is the minimum of nums2 for the current subsequence being considered, we get the maximum potential score for this subsequence in each iteration. 


## Solution in cpp
```
class Solution {
public:
    long long maxScore(std::vector<int>& nums1, std::vector<int>& nums2, int k) {
        int n = nums1.size(); // Get the size of the input vectors
        std::vector<std::pair<int, int>> nums(n);
      
        // Combine the elements from nums2 and nums1 into pairs with a negative value from nums2
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            nums[i] = {-nums2[i], nums1[i]};
        }

        // Sort the vector of pairs based on the first element in non-decreasing order
        std::sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());

        // Use a min heap to keep track of the k largest elements from nums1
        std::priority_queue<int, std::vector<int>, std::greater<int>> minHeap;
        long long ans = 0, sum = 0;

        // Iterate over the sorted pairs
        for (auto& [negNum2, num1] : nums) {
            sum += num1; // Add the value from nums1 to the sum
            minHeap.push(num1); // Push the value from nums1 into the min heap
          
            // Once the heap size reaches k, we calculate the potential maximum score
            if (minHeap.size() == k) {
                // Current score is the sum times the negated value from nums2 (to make it positive again)
                ans = std::max(ans, sum * -negNum2);

                // Remove the smallest element from sum to maintain the top k largest elements
                sum -= minHeap.top();
                minHeap.pop(); // Remove the element from the heap
            }
        }

        // Return the maximum score found
        return ans;
    }
};
```

## Solution in Python
```
from heapq import heappush, heappop

class Solution:
    def maxScore(self, cards1: List[int], cards2: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        # Combine the two lists into one by creating tuples of cards from cards2 and cards1
        # and sort the combined list in descending order based on cards2 values.
        combined_cards = sorted(zip(cards2, cards1), reverse=True)
      
        # Initialize a min-heap to keep track of the smallest elements.
        min_heap = []
        # Initialize sum and answer
        current_sum = 0
        max_score = 0
      
        # Iterate over the sorted list of combined cards.
        for card2_value, card1_value in combined_cards:
            # Add the value from cards1 to the current sum.
            current_sum += card1_value
            # Push the value from cards1 to the min-heap.
            heappush(min_heap, card1_value)
          
            # If the heap size reaches k, update the maximum score.
            # This corresponds to choosing k cards from cards1.
            if len(min_heap) == k:
                max_score = max(max_score, current_sum * card2_value)
                # Remove the smallest element from the current sum as we want the largest k elements.
                current_sum -= heappop(min_heap)
              
        # Return the maximum possible score.
        return max_score
```
