# Question

You are given a 0-indexed integer array costs where `costs[i]` is the cost of hiring the ith worker.

You are also given two integers k and candidates. We want to hire exactly k workers according to the following rules:

You will run k sessions and hire exactly one worker in each session.
In each hiring session, choose the worker with the lowest cost from either the first candidates workers or the last candidates workers. Break the tie by the smallest index.
For example, if costs = [3,2,7,7,1,2] and candidates = 2, then in the first hiring session, we will choose the 4th worker because they have the lowest cost [3,2,7,7,1,2].
In the second hiring session, we will choose 1st worker because they have the same lowest cost as 4th worker but they have the smallest index [3,2,7,7,2]. Please note that the indexing may be changed in the process.
If there are fewer than candidates workers remaining, choose the worker with the lowest cost among them. Break the tie by the smallest index.
A worker can only be chosen once.
Return the total cost to hire exactly k workers.
 
# Examples

Example 1:

Input: costs = [17,12,10,2,7,2,11,20,8], k = 3, candidates = 4
Output: 11
Explanation: We hire 3 workers in total. The total cost is initially 0.
- In the first hiring round we choose the worker from [17,12,10,2,7,2,11,20,8]. The lowest cost is 2, and we break the tie by the smallest index, which is 3. The total cost = 0 + 2 = 2.
- In the second hiring round we choose the worker from [17,12,10,7,2,11,20,8]. The lowest cost is 2 (index 4). The total cost = 2 + 2 = 4.
- In the third hiring round we choose the worker from [17,12,10,7,11,20,8]. The lowest cost is 7 (index 3). The total cost = 4 + 7 = 11. Notice that the worker with index 3 was common in the first and last four workers.
The total hiring cost is 11.

Example 2:

Input: costs = [1,2,4,1], k = 3, candidates = 3
Output: 4
Explanation: We hire 3 workers in total. The total cost is initially 0.
- In the first hiring round we choose the worker from [1,2,4,1]. The lowest cost is 1, and we break the tie by the smallest index, which is 0. The total cost = 0 + 1 = 1. Notice that workers with index 1 and 2 are common in the first and last 3 workers.
- In the second hiring round we choose the worker from [2,4,1]. The lowest cost is 1 (index 2). The total cost = 1 + 1 = 2.
- In the third hiring round there are less than three candidates. We choose the worker from the remaining workers [2,4]. The lowest cost is 2 (index 0). The total cost = 2 + 2 = 4.
The total hiring cost is 4.

## Explanation

Given the problem's constraints and the requirement to minimize the total hiring cost, it becomes evident that a greedy approach can be used to find the solution. The essence of this approach is to always pick the cheapest available worker during each hiring session.

An intuitive way to repeatedly find and hire the worker with the lowest cost is to use a min-heap, a data structure that allows us to efficiently retrieve and remove the minimum element. In each hiring session, the following operations are performed:

1. Push the costs and indices of the first candidates workers and the last candidates workers into a min-heap after filtering out workers who were previously hired.
2. Pop the worker with the lowest cost from the heap.
3. Include this cost in the running total of costs.
4. Adjust the range of workers considered for the next session to exclude the worker just hired.

## Algorithm

1. Initialize the min-heap with candidate workers: Two pointers, i and j, are used to mark the boundary of the first and last candidates workers. The first candidates workers and the last candidates workers are pushed into the heap along with their indices. The heap is then heapified to establish the min-heap property.
2. Hire workers in k sessions: A total of k hiring sessions are to be conducted. In each session:
    1. The worker with the lowest cost is popped from the heap using heappop().
    2. The cost of the hired worker is added to the total cost ans.
    3. Depending on the index of the worker hired, the pointers i and j are updated to ensure the correct range of candidates for the next hiring session.
    4. If a worker from the first candidates (lower part of the range) is hired, the pointer i is incremented.
    5. Conversely, if a worker from the last candidates (upper part of the range) is hired, the pointer j is decremented.
    6. Provided there are still candidates between the updated i and j, a new worker is pushed onto the heap from the updated index position.
3. Return the total cost: Once all k sessions are complete and k workers are hired, the accumulated total cost (ans) is returned as the answer to the problem.


## Solution in cpp
```
class Solution {
public:
    long long totalCost(vector<int>& costs, int k, int candidates) {
        int n = costs.size();
        if (candidates * 2 > n) {
            sort(costs.begin(), costs.end());
            return accumulate(costs.begin(), costs.begin() + k, 0LL);
        }
        using pii = pair<int, int>;
        priority_queue<pii, vector<pii>, greater<pii>> pq;
        for (int i = 0; i < candidates; ++i) {
            pq.emplace(costs[i], i);
            pq.emplace(costs[n - i - 1], n - i - 1);
        }
        long long ans = 0;
        int l = candidates, r = n - candidates - 1;
        while (k--) {
            auto [cost, i] = pq.top();
            pq.pop();
            ans += cost;
            if (l > r) {
                continue;
            }
            if (i < l) {
                pq.emplace(costs[l], l++);
            } else {
                pq.emplace(costs[r], r--);
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```

## Solution in Python
```
class Solution:
    def totalCost(self, costs: List[int], k: int, candidates: int) -> int:
        # Priority queue to store costs with their respective indices
        priority_queue = []
        n = len(costs)  # The total number of costs provided
      
        # Calculate the boundary indices for the candidates
        left_candidate_bound = candidates - 1
        right_candidate_bound = n - candidates
      
        # Populate the priority queue with the left side candidates
        for index in range(candidates):
            priority_queue.append((costs[index], index))
      
        # Populate the priority queue with the right side candidates
        for index in range(n - candidates, n):
            # Only add if we're past 'left_candidate_bound'
            if index > left_candidate_bound:
                priority_queue.append((costs[index], index))
      
        # Transform the priority_queue into a min-heap
        heapify(priority_queue)
      
        # Variable to keep the running total cost of the selected candidates
        total_cost = 0
      
        # Retrieve the smallest costs 'k' times
        for _ in range(k):
            # Extract the candidate with the smallest cost
            cost, index = heappop(priority_queue)
            total_cost += cost
          
            # If selected from the left side, we need to move the left boundary right
            if index <= left_candidate_bound:
                left_candidate_bound += 1
                if left_candidate_bound < right_candidate_bound:
                    heappush(priority_queue, (costs[left_candidate_bound], left_candidate_bound))
          
            # If selected from the right side, we need to move the right boundary left
            if index >= right_candidate_bound:
                right_candidate_bound -= 1
                if left_candidate_bound < right_candidate_bound:
                    heappush(priority_queue, (costs[right_candidate_bound], right_candidate_bound))
      
        return total_cost
```
