# Question

There is a biker going on a road trip. The road trip consists of `n + 1` points at different altitudes. The biker starts his trip on point 0 with altitude equal `0`.

You are given an integer array gain of length `n` where `gain[i]` is the net gain in altitude between points `i`​​​​​​ and `i + 1` for all `(0 <= i < n)`. Return the highest altitude of a point.

# Examples

Example 1:

Input: gain = [-5,1,5,0,-7]
Output: 1
Explanation: The altitudes are [0,-5,-4,1,1,-6]. The highest is 1.

Example 2:

Input: gain = [-4,-3,-2,-1,4,3,2]
Output: 0
Explanation: The altitudes are [0,-4,-7,-9,-10,-6,-3,-1]. The highest is 0.

## Explanation

To solve this problem, we need to keep track of the biker's altitude as he moves from one point to the next. We start at an altitude of 0 and add the net gain from the gain array consecutively to find the altitude at each subsequent point. While doing this, we keep an eye on the highest altitude reached thus far.

## Algorithm

1. Loop over through the height list and check the height.  
2. Sav the max height. 
3. Return answer.


## Solution in cpp
```
class Solution {
public:
    int largestAltitude(vector<int>& gain) {
        int ans = 0, h = 0;
        for (int v : gain) h += v, ans = max(ans, h);
        return ans;      
    }
};
```

## Solution in Python
```
class Solution:
  def largestAltitude(self, gain: list[int]) -> int:
    ans = 0
    currAltitude = 0
    for g in gain:
      currAltitude += g
      ans = max(ans, currAltitude)
    return ans
```

Time Complexity: O(n) -> looping through the complete array once. <br>
Space complexity: O(1) -> we are not creating any extra space.
