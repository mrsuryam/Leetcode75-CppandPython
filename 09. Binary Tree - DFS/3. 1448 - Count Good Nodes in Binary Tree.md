# Question

Given a binary tree root, a node X in the tree is named good if in the path from root to X there are no nodes with a value greater than X.

Return the number of good nodes in the binary tree.

 
# Examples

Example 1:


Input: root = [3,1,4,3,null,1,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Nodes in blue are good.
Root Node (3) is always a good node.
Node 4 -> (3,4) is the maximum value in the path starting from the root.
Node 5 -> (3,4,5) is the maximum value in the path
Node 3 -> (3,1,3) is the maximum value in the path.

Example 2:


Input: root = [3,3,null,4,2]
Output: 3
Explanation: Node 2 -> (3, 3, 2) is not good, because "3" is higher than it.
Example 3:

Input: root = [1]
Output: 1
Explanation: Root is considered as good.

## Explanation

The key to solving this problem is to maintain the max value encountered along the path from the root to the current node. We perform a depth-first search (DFS) traversal of the tree and carry the maximum value found so far to each node's children. At each node, we do two checks:

If the current node's value is greater than or equal to the max value we've seen so far on this path, it qualifies as a good node, and we increment our count of good nodes. We also update the max value to the current node's value, because it's now the highest value seen on the path for the subtree rooted at this node.

We continue to traverse the tree by going left and right, carrying forward this updated max value to be used for the node's children.

## Algorithm

1. Take two pointers, one for starting and the other one at the end of string. 
2. while ( first <= end), check for the chars for vowels. 
3. If both are not vowels, increment first pointer and decrement last pointer. 
4. If one of them are vowels, increment/decrement the other one. 
5. If both are vowels, then swap the characters. 
8. Return the string.


## Solution in cpp
```
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    int goodNodes(TreeNode* root) {
        int ans = 0;
        function<void(TreeNode*, int)> dfs = [&](TreeNode* root, int mx) {
            if (!root) {
                return;
            }
            if (mx <= root->val) {
                ++ans;
                mx = root->val;
            }
            dfs(root->left, mx);
            dfs(root->right, mx);
        };
        dfs(root, -1e6);
        return ans;      
    }
};
```

## Solution in Python
```
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def goodNodes(self, root: TreeNode) -> int:
        def dfs(node: TreeNode, max_val: int):
            if node is None:
                return
          
            nonlocal good_nodes_count
          
            if max_val <= node.val:
                good_nodes_count += 1
                max_val = node.val
          
            dfs(node.left, max_val)
            dfs(node.right, max_val)

        good_nodes_count = 0
        dfs(root, float('-inf'))
        return good_nodes_count
```
Time Complexity: O(n) -> looping through the complete array from both ends.
Space complexity: O(1) -> we are not creating any extra space.
