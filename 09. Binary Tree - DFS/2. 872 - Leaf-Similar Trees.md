# Question

Consider all the leaves of a binary tree, from left to right order, the values of those leaves form a leaf value sequence.


For example, in the given tree above, the leaf value sequence is (6, 7, 4, 9, 8).

Two binary trees are considered leaf-similar if their leaf value sequence is the same.

Return true if and only if the two given trees with head nodes root1 and root2 are leaf-similar.


# Examples

Example 1:


Input: root1 = [3,5,1,6,2,9,8,null,null,7,4], root2 = [3,5,1,6,7,4,2,null,null,null,null,null,null,9,8]
Output: true
Example 2:


Input: root1 = [1,2,3], root2 = [1,3,2]
Output: false

## Explanation

Leaf nodes are the nodes where there are no children. The left and right subtrees of the leaf node are null.
The goal here is to find the leaf nodes and add it to a list, then compare the list and return result. 

To find the leaf node, use recursion and traverse through each node, first the left subtree, then the right subtree.

## Algorithm

1. We need to find the leaf nodes first using recursion and add them to a list.  
2. To find the leaf nodes, traverse through the left subtrees first, until you find a node where there are no children.
3. Then traverse through the right subtrees.
4. Once you get a leaf node, add it to the list. 
5. Compare the list and return result. 


## Solution in cpp

```
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    bool leafSimilar(TreeNode* root1, TreeNode* root2) {
        vector<int> l1, l2;
        dfs(root1, l1);
        dfs(root2, l2);
        return l1 == l2;
    }

    void dfs(TreeNode* root, vector<int>& nums) {
         if (root->left == nullptr && root->right == nullptr) {
            nums.push_back(root->val);
            return;
        }
        if (root->left) {
            dfs(root->left, nums);
        }
        if (root->right) {
            dfs(root->right, nums);
        }
        
    }
};

```
## Solution in python 

```
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def leafSimilar(self, root1: Optional[TreeNode], root2: Optional[TreeNode]) -> bool:
        def dfs(root: TreeNode | None) -> None:
            if not root:
                return
            if not root.left and not root.right:
                yield root.val
                return

            yield from dfs(root.left)
            yield from dfs(root.right)

        return list(dfs(root1)) == list(dfs(root2))

```
Time Complexity: O(n) -> We loop through each node of the tree. 
Space complexity: O(1) -> we are not creating any extra space.
