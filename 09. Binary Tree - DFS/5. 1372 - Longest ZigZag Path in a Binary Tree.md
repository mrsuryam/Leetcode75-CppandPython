# Question

You are given the root of a binary tree.

A ZigZag path for a binary tree is defined as follow:

Choose any node in the binary tree and a direction (right or left).
If the current direction is right, move to the right child of the current node; otherwise, move to the left child.
Change the direction from right to left or from left to right.
Repeat the second and third steps until you can't move in the tree.
Zigzag length is defined as the number of nodes visited - 1. (A single node has a length of 0).

Return the longest ZigZag path contained in that tree.


# Examples

Example 1:

Input: root = [1,null,1,1,1,null,null,1,1,null,1,null,null,null,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: Longest ZigZag path in blue nodes (right -> left -> right).

Example 2:

Input: root = [1,1,1,null,1,null,null,1,1,null,1]
Output: 4
Explanation: Longest ZigZag path in blue nodes (left -> right -> left -> right).

Example 3:

Input: root = [1]
Output: 0

## Solution in cpp
```
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };

class Solution {
public:
     int ans = 0;

    int longestZigZag(TreeNode* root) {
        dfs(root, 0, 0);
        return ans;
    }

    void dfs(TreeNode* root, int l, int r) {
        if (!root) return;
        ans = max(ans, max(l, r));
        dfs(root->left, r + 1, 0);
        dfs(root->right, 0, l + 1);
    }
};
```

## Solution in Python
```
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None

class Solution:
    def longestZigZag(self, root: TreeNode) -> int:
        # Helper function to perform DFS (Depth-First Search) on the tree
        def dfs(node, left_length, right_length):
            # If the node is None, we've reached the end of a path
            if node is None:
                return
            # Update the global answer by taking the maximum value found so far
            nonlocal max_length
            max_length = max(max_length, left_length, right_length)
            # Recursively explore the left child, incrementing the "left_length" as we are
            # making a zig (left direction) from the right side of the current node
            dfs(node.left, right_length + 1, 0)
            # Recursively explore the right child, incrementing the "right_length" as we are
            # making a zag (right direction) from the left side of the current node
            dfs(node.right, 0, left_length + 1)
      
        # Initialize the maximum length to 0 before starting DFS
        max_length = 0
        # Start DFS with the root of the tree, initial lengths are 0 as starting point
        dfs(root, 0, 0)
        # Once DFS is complete, return the maximum zigzag length found
        return max_length     
```

Time Complexity: O(n) -> We traverse through all the nodes in the tree. <br>
Space complexity: O(n) -> recursion call stack might occupy based on nodes on tree.  Best case -> O(h)
