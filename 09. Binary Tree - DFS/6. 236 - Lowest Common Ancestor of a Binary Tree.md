# Question

Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.

According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”


# Examples

Example 1:

Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 1
Output: 3
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 1 is 3.

Example 2:

Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 4
Output: 5
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 4 is 5, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.

Example 3:

Input: root = [1,2], p = 1, q = 2
Output: 1

## Explanation

use recursion and post order traversal to traverse through subtrees. 

If both the left and right subtree recursive calls return non-null nodes, it means both p and q have been found in different subtrees, and therefore the current node is their lowest common ancestor.
If only one of the calls returns a non-null node, that indicates the current subtree contains at least one of the two nodes, and potentially both. The non-null node is returned up the call stack.
If both calls return null, it means neither p nor q was found in the current subtree, and null is returned.

## Algorithm

1. A Recursive Function. which takes the current node along with p and q. 
2. The base case, where any node can be null.
3. Search left and right subtrees, with same function.
4. Use the LCA detection technique as stated above. 
5. Return the node.

## Solution in cpp
```
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    TreeNode* lowestCommonAncestor(TreeNode* root, TreeNode* p, TreeNode* q) {
        if (root == nullptr || root == p || root == q) {
            return root;
        }
        auto left = lowestCommonAncestor(root->left, p, q);
        auto right = lowestCommonAncestor(root->right, p, q);
        if (left && right) {
            return root;
        }
        return left ? left : right;
    }
};;
```

## Solution in Python
```
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None

class Solution:
    def lowestCommonAncestor(self, root: 'TreeNode', p: 'TreeNode', q: 'TreeNode') -> 'TreeNode':
        if root is None or root == p or root == q:
            return root
        left = self.lowestCommonAncestor(root.left, p, q)
        right = self.lowestCommonAncestor(root.right, p, q)
        return root if left and right else (left or right)     
```

Time Complexity: O(n) -> We traverse through all the nodes in the tree. <br>
Space complexity: O(n) -> recursion call stack might occupy based on nodes on tree.
