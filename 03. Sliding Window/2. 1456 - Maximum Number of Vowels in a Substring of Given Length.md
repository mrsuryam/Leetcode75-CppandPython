# Question

Given a string `s` and an integer `k`, return the maximum number of vowel letters in any substring of `s` with length `k`.

Vowel letters in English are 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u'.


# Examples

Example 1:

Input: s = "abciiidef", k = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: The substring "iii" contains 3 vowel letters.

Example 2:

Input: s = "aeiou", k = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: Any substring of length 2 contains 2 vowels.

Example 3:

Input: s = "leetcode", k = 3
Output: 2
Explanation: "lee", "eet" and "ode" contain 2 vowels.

## Explanation

The idea is to maintain a window of size k that slides over the string s from the beginning to the end. This window keeps track of the number of vowels in the current substring of length k.

## Algorithm

1. Initialize a set of vowels for quick look-up.
2. Start by counting the number of vowels in the first substring of length k.
3. As you slide the window by one position to the right, add one to the count if the incoming character is a vowel and subtract one if the outgoing character is a vowel.
4. Update the maximum number of vowels found so far.


## Solution in cpp
```
class Solution {
public:
    int maxVowels(string s, int k) {
        auto isVowel = [](char c) {
            return c == 'a' || c == 'e' || c == 'i' || c == 'o' || c == 'u';
        };
        // just like accumulate algorithm.
        int cnt = count_if(s.begin(), s.begin() + k, isVowel);
        int ans = cnt;
        for (int i = k; i < s.size(); ++i) {
            // Find the new one and old one.
            cnt += isVowel(s[i]) - isVowel(s[i - k]);
            ans = max(ans, cnt);
        }
        return ans;   
    }
};
```

## Solution in python
```
class Solution:
  def maxVowels(self, s: str, k: int) -> int:
    ans = 0
    mx = 0
    kVowels = 'aeiou'

    for i, c in enumerate(s):
      if c in kVowels:
        mx += 1
      if i >= k and s[i - k] in kVowels:
        mx -= 1
      ans = max(ans, mx)

    return ans
```

Time Complexity: O(n) -> looping through the whole array. <br>
Space complexity: O(1) -> we are not creating any extra space.
