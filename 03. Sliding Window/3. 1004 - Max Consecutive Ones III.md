# Question

Given a binary array `nums` and an integer `k`, return the maximum number of consecutive `1's` in the array if you can flip at most `k 0's`.


# Examples

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0], k = 2
Output: 6
Explanation: [1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1]

Example 2:

Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1], k = 3
Output: 10
Explanation: [0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1]

## Explanation

This is a variable size sliding window problem, please see the Algorithm.

## Algorithm

1. We aim to find the longest sequence of 1s which may include k or fewer flipped 0s.
2. We initialize two pointers l (left) and r (right) which define the current window. The window starts with no elements (both pointers at -1).
3. We iterate through the array with the r pointer incremented in each step examining each element. We expand the window by moving r to the right.
4. If a 0 is encountered, we decrease the count of k because we are envisioning a flip happening here to turn it into a 1 for the sake of our current sequence.
5. If k becomes negative, it means our window has too many 0s (more than the allowed k flips). We need to shrink the window from the left by incrementing l. Each time we pass a 0 while moving l to the right, we increment k back as we are effectively undoing a flip.
6. Throughout this process, we are implicitly tracking the length of the current window. The maximum length encountered during the iteration is the length of the longest sequence we are looking for.
7. The length of the window is always r - l, but since our pointers start from -1, when the right pointer has reached the end of the array (index len(nums) - 1), the window length is simply r - l without needing to add one for usual zero-based index arrays.


## Solution in cpp
```
class Solution {
public:
    int longestOnes(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        int l = 0;   
        int r = 0; 
        int len = 0;

        while (r < nums.size()) {
            // If we encounter a 0, decrement k (the flip count)
            if (nums[r] == 0) {
                --k;
            }

            // Move the right pointer to the next element
            ++r;

            // If k is negative, it means we've flipped more 0s than allowed
            while (k < 0) {
                // If the left element is 0, we increment k 
                // since we are moving past the flipped zero
                if (nums[l] == 0) {
                    ++k;
                }
                // Move the left pointer to the right, effectively shrinking the window
                ++l;
            }

            // Update maxOnesLength if the current window is larger
            len = max(len, r - l);
        }
      
        // Return the maximum length of the subarray
        return len;
    }
};
```

## Solution in Python
```
class Solution:
  def longestOnes(self, nums: list[int], k: int) -> int:

    ans = 0
    l = 0

    for r, num in enumerate(nums):
      if num == 0:
        k -= 1
      while k < 0:
        if nums[l] == 0:
          k += 1
        l += 1
      ans = max(ans, r - l + 1)

    return ans
```

Time Complexity: O(n) -> looping through the complete array. <br>
Space complexity: O(1) -> we are not creating any extra space.
