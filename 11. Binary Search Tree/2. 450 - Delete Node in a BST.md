# Question

Given a root node reference of a BST and a key, delete the node with the given key in the BST. Return the root node reference (possibly updated) of the BST.

Basically, the deletion can be divided into two stages:

Search for a node to remove.
If the node is found, delete the node.
 
# Examples

Example 1:

Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,7], key = 3
Output: [5,4,6,2,null,null,7]
Explanation: Given key to delete is 3. So we find the node with value 3 and delete it.
One valid answer is [5,4,6,2,null,null,7], shown in the above BST.
Please notice that another valid answer is [5,2,6,null,4,null,7] and it's also accepted.

Example 2:

Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,7], key = 0
Output: [5,3,6,2,4,null,7]
Explanation: The tree does not contain a node with value = 0.
Example 3:

Input: root = [], key = 0
Output: []

class Solution {
public:
    TreeNode* deleteNode(TreeNode* root, int key) {
        // If root is null, return immediately
        if (!root) {
            return root;
        }

        // to be deleted

        // Node with only one child or no child

        if (!root->right) {

        }

        // Node with two children: Get the inorder successor (smallest
        // in the right subtree)
        TreeNode* successorNode = root->right;
        while (successorNode->left) {
            successorNode = successorNode->left;
        }

        // Copy the inorder successor's content to this node
        root->val = successorNode->val;
      
        // Delete the inorder successor since its value is now copied 
        root->right = deleteNode(root->right, successorNode->val);

        return root;
    }

class Solution:
    def deleteNode(self, root: Optional[TreeNode], key: int) -> Optional[TreeNode]:
       # If the root is None, then there is nothing to delete, return None
        if root is None:
            return None

        # If the key to be deleted is smaller than the root's key, 
        # then it lies in the left subtree
        if key < root.val:
            root.left = self.deleteNode(root.left, key)
            return root

        # then it lies in the right subtree
        if key > root.val:
            root.right = self.deleteNode(root.right, key)
            return root

        # If the key is the same as root's key, then this is the node to be deleted

        # If the node has only one child or no child
        if root.left is None:
            return root.right

        if root.right is None:
            return root.left

        # If the node has two children, get the inorder successor
        # (smallest in the right subtree)
        min_right_subtree = root.right
        while min_right_subtree.left:
            min_right_subtree = min_right_subtree.left

        # Copy the inorder successor's content to this node
        root.val = min_right_subtree.val

        # Delete the inorder successor
        root.right = self.deleteNode(root.right, min_right_subtree.val)

        return root
```
Time Complexity: 
O(h) -> h is height of tree. 
O(log n) -> balanced BST 
O(n) -> skewed BST 
Space complexity: O(h) -> We give max h calls.
