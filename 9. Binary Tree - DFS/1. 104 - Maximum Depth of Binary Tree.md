# Question

Given the root of a binary tree, return its maximum depth.

A binary tree's maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.


 
# Examples

Example 1:


Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: 3
Example 2:

Input: root = [1,null,2]
Output: 2

## Explanation

They are two ways, 
1) Using Recursion 
Recursively calculate the height of the left and the right subtrees of a node and assign height to the node as max of the heights of two children plus 1. 
2) using a queue and level order traversal.

## Algorithm

1. We start by checking root == nullptr, if root is null, return 0.
2. If root is not null, then start by left and right childs of the root. 
3. Find the max depth of either of the child nodes and 1 to it.(the current root node). 
4. Return the total length.


## Solution in cpp

```
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    int maxDepth(TreeNode* root) {
        if (root == nullptr) 
            return 0;
        return 1 + max(maxDepth(root->left), maxDepth(root->right));   
    }
};

```
## Solution in python

```
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
  def maxDepth(self, root: TreeNode | None) -> int:
    if not root:
      return 0
    return 1 + max(self.maxDepth(root.left), self.maxDepth(root.right))

```

Time Complexity: O(n) -> We loop through each node of the tree. 
Space complexity: O(1) -> we are not creating any extra space.
