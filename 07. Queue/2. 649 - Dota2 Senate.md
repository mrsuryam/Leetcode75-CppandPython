# Question

In the world of Dota2, there are two parties: the Radiant and the Dire.

The Dota2 senate consists of senators coming from two parties. Now the Senate wants to decide on a change in the Dota2 game. The voting for this change is a round-based procedure. In each round, each senator can exercise one of the two rights:

Ban one senator's right: A senator can make another senator lose all his rights in this and all the following rounds.
Announce the victory: If this senator found the senators who still have rights to vote are all from the same party, he can announce the victory and decide on the change in the game.
Given a string senate representing each senator's party belonging. The character 'R' and 'D' represent the Radiant party and the Dire party. Then if there are n senators, the size of the given string will be n.

The round-based procedure starts from the first senator to the last senator in the given order. This procedure will last until the end of voting. All the senators who have lost their rights will be skipped during the procedure.

Suppose every senator is smart enough and will play the best strategy for his own party. Predict which party will finally announce the victory and change the Dota2 game. The output should be "Radiant" or "Dire".

# Examples

Example 1:

Input: senate = "RD"
Output: "Radiant"
Explanation: 
The first senator comes from Radiant and he can just ban the next senator's right in round 1. 
And the second senator can't exercise any rights anymore since his right has been banned. 
And in round 2, the first senator can just announce the victory since he is the only guy in the senate who can vote.

Example 2:

Input: senate = "RDD"
Output: "Dire"
Explanation: 
The first senator comes from Radiant and he can just ban the next senator's right in round 1. 
And the second senator can't exercise any rights anymore since his right has been banned. 
And the third senator comes from Dire and he can ban the first senator's right in round 1. 
And in round 2, the third senator can just announce the victory since he is the only guy in the senate who can vote.

## Explanation

The solution involves simulating the process using a queue data structure. For simplicity and efficiency, we use a separate queue for each party, recording the positions (indices) of their senators in the senate list. Our goal is to simulate each round where senators ban their immediate opponent senator (if available).

The key insights to arrive at the solution are:

Senators will always ban the next senator of the opposite party to maximize their party's chance of victory.
Once a senator has made a move, they go to the end of the queue but with an increased index representing their new position in the "virtual" order. This is done to maintain the cyclic nature of the senate arrangement.
The process continues until one party's queue is empty, meaning no more senators from that party are left to cast votes or make bans.

By dequeuing the first senator of each party and having them ban the opponent's first senator, we simulate the banning process while keeping track of the new positions. If a Radiant senator acts before a Dire senator, they add to the end of their queue by considering the size of the senate (senate), effectively banning the first Dire senator. The same logic applies when a Dire senator acts before a Radiant senator.

## Algorithm

1. Iterate through the senate string and fill the queues qr and qd with indices of the senators belonging to the Radiant and Dire parties, respectively. 
2. Enter a loop that will run until one of the queues is empty. The condition while qr and qd: ensures that the loop continues as long as there are senators from both parties available to take action. 
3. In each iteration of the loop:
    Compare the indices at the front of both qr and qd which represents the order in which the senators will take action. The senator with the lower index is able to act first.
    If the first Radiant senator (qr[0]) is before the first Dire senator (qd[0]), the Radiant senator will ban the Dire senator. The Radiant senator's index is then added back to the qr queue, incremented by n, which is the length of the senate string. This effectively places them at the end of the order for the next round.
    Similarly, if the Dire senator acts first, they will ban the Radiant senator, and their index (incremented by n) will be added back to the qd queue.
    After a senator has acted (either banning or being banned), we remove them from the front of the queue using popleft().
4. After exiting the loop, we check which queue still has senators left, which determines the victorious party. If qr is not empty, Radiant wins; otherwise, Dire wins.
5. Finally, return "Radiant" if the qr queue has senators left, or "Dire" if the qd queue has senators left.

## Solution in cpp
```
class Solution {
public:
    string predictPartyVictory(string senate) {
        int n = senate.size();
        queue<int> qr;
        queue<int> qd;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            if (senate[i] == 'R') {
                qr.push(i);
            } else {
                qd.push(i);
            }
        }
        while (!qr.empty() && !qd.empty()) {
            int r = qr.front();
            int d = qd.front();
            qr.pop();
            qd.pop();
            if (r < d) {
                qr.push(r + n);
            } else {
                qd.push(d + n);
            }
        }
        return qr.empty() ? "Dire" : "Radiant";       
    }
};
```

## Solution in Python
```
class Solution:
    def predict_party_victory(self, senate: str) -> str:
        # Initialize queues for Radiant and Dire senators' indices
        queue_radiant = deque()
        queue_dire = deque()
      
        # Populate initial queues with the indices of the Radiant and Dire senators
        for index, senator in enumerate(senate):
            if senator == "R":
                queue_radiant.append(index)
            else:
                queue_dire.append(index)
      
        # Calculate the length of the senate for future indexing
        n = len(senate)
      
        # Process the two queues
        while queue_radiant and queue_dire:
            # Take the first senator from each queue and compare their indices
            if queue_radiant[0] < queue_dire[0]:
                # If the Radiant senator comes first, they ban a Dire senator
                # and put themselves at the back of their queue with a new hypothetical index
                queue_radiant.append(queue_radiant[0] + n)
            else:
                # If the Dire senator comes first, they ban a Radiant senator
                # and put themselves at the back of their queue with a new hypothetical index
                queue_dire.append(queue_dire[0] + n)
          
            # Remove the senators who have exercised their powers
            queue_radiant.popleft()
            queue_dire.popleft()
      
        # Return the winning party's name based on which queue still has senators
        return "Radiant" if queue_radiant else "Dire"
```
