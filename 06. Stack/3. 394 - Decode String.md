# Question

Given an encoded string, return its decoded string.

The encoding rule is: k[encoded_string], where the encoded_string inside the square brackets is being repeated exactly k times. Note that k is guaranteed to be a positive integer.

You may assume that the input string is always valid; there are no extra white spaces, square brackets are well-formed, etc. Furthermore, you may assume that the original data does not contain any digits and that digits are only for those repeat numbers, k. For example, there will not be input like 3a or 2[4].

The test cases are generated so that the length of the output will never exceed 105.

# Examples

Example 1:

Input: s = "3[a]2[bc]"
Output: "aaabcbc"
Example 2:

Input: s = "3[a2[c]]"
Output: "accaccacc"
Example 3:

Input: s = "2[abc]3[cd]ef"
Output: "abcabccdcdcdef"

## Explanation

The idea here is to use a stack to store the string that is to be repeated and the repeatCount number. Iterate through the given string and insert the count and the repeatString to the stack. COnstruct a new string at the end and return.

## Algorithm

1. Initialize a new stack that accepts <string, int>, the string is the repeatString and int is the repeatCount.
2. Loop through the given input string. 
  1. If it is a number, save it.
  2. If it is '[', push everything that you have on to the stack and reset the variables.
  3. if it is ']', pop the value from the stack and calculate the string.
  4. else that will be astring, save it in temp variable. 
3. Repeat untill you iterate through whole string.


## Solution in cpp
```
class Solution {
 public:
  string decodeString(string s) {
    stack<pair<string, int>> stack;  // (prevStr, repeatCount)
    string currStr;
    int currNum = 0;

    for (const char c : s)
      if (isdigit(c)) {
        currNum = currNum * 10 + (c - '0');
      } else {
        if (c == '[') {
          stack.emplace(currStr, currNum);
          currStr = "";
          currNum = 0;
        } else if (c == ']') {
          const auto [prevStr, n] = stack.top();
          stack.pop();
          currStr = prevStr + getRepeatedStr(currStr, n);
        } else {
          currStr += c;
        }
      }

    return currStr;
  }

 private:
  // Returns s * n.
  string getRepeatedStr(const string& s, int n) {
    string repeat;
    while (n-- > 0)
      repeat += s;
    return repeat;
  }
};
```

## Solution in Python
```
class Solution:
  def decodeString(self, s: str) -> str:
    stack = []  # (prevStr, repeatCount)
    currStr = ''
    currNum = 0

    for c in s:
      if c.isdigit():
        currNum = currNum * 10 + int(c)
      else:
        if c == '[':
          stack.append((currStr, currNum))
          currStr = ''
          currNum = 0
        elif c == ']':
          prevStr, num = stack.pop()
          currStr = prevStr + num * currStr
        else:
          currStr += c

    return currStr
```
Time Complexity: O(n) -> looping through the complete array. <br>
Space complexity: O(n) -> we are creating extra space.
