# Question

There are some spherical balloons taped onto a flat wall that represents the XY-plane. The balloons are represented as a 2D integer array points where points[i] = [xstart, xend] denotes a balloon whose horizontal diameter stretches between xstart and xend. You do not know the exact y-coordinates of the balloons.

Arrows can be shot up directly vertically (in the positive y-direction) from different points along the x-axis. A balloon with xstart and xend is burst by an arrow shot at x if xstart <= x <= xend. There is no limit to the number of arrows that can be shot. A shot arrow keeps traveling up infinitely, bursting any balloons in its path.

Given the array points, return the minimum number of arrows that must be shot to burst all balloons.

# Examples

Example 1:

Input: points = [[10,16],[2,8],[1,6],[7,12]]
Output: 2
Explanation: The balloons can be burst by 2 arrows:
- Shoot an arrow at x = 6, bursting the balloons [2,8] and [1,6].
- Shoot an arrow at x = 11, bursting the balloons [10,16] and [7,12].
Example 2:

Input: points = [[1,2],[3,4],[5,6],[7,8]]
Output: 4
Explanation: One arrow needs to be shot for each balloon for a total of 4 arrows.
Example 3:

Input: points = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[4,5]]
Output: 2
Explanation: The balloons can be burst by 2 arrows:
- Shoot an arrow at x = 2, bursting the balloons [1,2] and [2,3].
- Shoot an arrow at x = 4, bursting the balloons [3,4] and [4,5].


## Explanation

TBD.

## Algorithm

TBD

## Solution in cpp
```
class Solution {
 public:
  int findMinArrowShots(vector<vector<int>>& points) {
    ranges::sort(points,
                 [](const auto& a, const auto& b) { return a[1] < b[1]; });

    int ans = 1;
    int arrowX = points[0][1];

    for (int i = 1; i < points.size(); ++i)
      if (points[i][0] > arrowX) {
        arrowX = points[i][1];
        ++ans;
      }

    return ans;
  }
};
```

## Solution in Python
```
class Solution:
  def findMinArrowShots(self, points: list[list[int]]) -> int:
    ans = 0
    arrowX = -math.inf

    for point in sorted(points, key=lambda x: x[1]):
      if point[0] > arrowX:
        ans += 1
        arrowX = point[1]

    return ans
```
