# Question

Given the root of a binary tree, the level of its root is 1, the level of its children is 2, and so on.

Return the smallest level x such that the sum of all the values of nodes at level x is maximal.
 
# Examples

Example 1:

Input: root = [1,7,0,7,-8,null,null]
Output: 2
Explanation: 
Level 1 sum = 1.
Level 2 sum = 7 + 0 = 7.
Level 3 sum = 7 + -8 = -1.
So we return the level with the maximum sum which is level 2.

Example 2:

Input: root = [989,null,10250,98693,-89388,null,null,null,-32127]
Output: 2

## Explanation

we can use breadth-first search (BFS), which is an algorithm that starts at the tree root and explores all nodes at the present depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level. while traversing through the levels, maintain two variables which has the max sum and the max sum level. 

## Algorithm

1. Take a queue and initialize with root node.
2. While queue is not empty, traverse through the nodes, if the node has childs add them to the queue.
3. For every level, find the sum of all the nodes present in the queue and also maintain the level of tree. 
4. Save them if it is max sum and min level.
5. return the level at the end.


## Solution in cpp
```
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    int maxLevelSum(TreeNode* root) {
        queue<TreeNode*> q{{root}};
        int mx = INT_MIN;
        int ans = 0;
        int i = 0;
        while (!q.empty()) {
            ++i;
            int s = 0;
            for (int n = q.size(); n; --n) {
                root = q.front();
                q.pop();
                s += root->val;
                if (root->left) q.push(root->left);
                if (root->right) q.push(root->right);
            }
            if (mx < s) mx = s, ans = i;
        }
        return ans;       
    }
};
```

## Solution in Python 
```
# Definition for a binary tree node.
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

class Solution:
    def maxLevelSum(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
        queue = deque([root])
        max_sum = -inf
        level = 0
        answer = 0
      
        while queue:
            level += 1
            current_sum = 0
            for _ in range(len(queue)):
                node = queue.popleft()
                current_sum += node.val
                if node.left:
                    queue.append(node.left)
                if node.right:
                    queue.append(node.right)
            if max_sum < current_sum:
                max_sum = current_sum
                answer = level

        return answer
```

Time Complexity: O(n) -> We are traversing and visiting each node. <br>
Space complexity: O(n) ->  We are also placing the level nodes to the queue, it is n/2 and worst case is N.
