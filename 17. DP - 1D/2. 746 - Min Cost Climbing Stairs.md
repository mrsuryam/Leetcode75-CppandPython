# Question

You are given an integer array cost where `cost[i]` is the cost of ith step on a staircase. Once you pay the cost, you can either climb one or two steps.

You can either start from the step with index 0, or the step with index 1.

Return the minimum cost to reach the top of the floor.

# Examples

Example 1:

Input: cost = [10,15,20]
Output: 15
Explanation: You will start at index 1.
- Pay 15 and climb two steps to reach the top.
The total cost is 15.

Example 2:

Input: cost = [1,100,1,1,1,100,1,1,100,1]
Output: 6
Explanation: You will start at index 0.
- Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 2.
- Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 4.
- Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 6.
- Pay 1 and climb one step to reach index 7.
- Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 9.
- Pay 1 and climb one step to reach the top.
The total cost is 6.

## Explanation

The algorithm uses two variables, a and b, to keep track of the minimum costs up to the two previous steps, respectively. These two variables eliminate the need for an additional auxiliary array that would keep track of the minimum costs for all steps, thus saving space. In algorithmic terms, we reduce the space complexity from O(n) to O(1) by using this approach.

## Algorithm

TBD

## Solution in cpp
```
class Solution {
 public:
  int minCostClimbingStairs(vector<int>& cost) {
    const int n = cost.size();

    for (int i = 2; i < n; ++i)
      cost[i] += min(cost[i - 1], cost[i - 2]);

    return min(cost[n - 1], cost[n - 2]);
  }
};
```

## Solution in Python
```
class Solution:
  def minCostClimbingStairs(self, cost: list[int]) -> int:
    cost.append(0)

    for i in range(2, len(cost)):
      cost[i] += min(cost[i - 1], cost[i - 2])

    return cost[-1]
```
