# Question

Given a 0-indexed n x n integer matrix grid, return the number of pairs (ri, cj) such that row ri and column cj are equal.

A row and column pair is considered equal if they contain the same elements in the same order (i.e., an equal array).


# Examples

Example 1:


Input: grid = [[3,2,1],[1,7,6],[2,7,7]]
Output: 1
Explanation: There is 1 equal row and column pair:
- (Row 2, Column 1): [2,7,7]

Example 2:


Input: grid = [[3,1,2,2],[1,4,4,5],[2,4,2,2],[2,4,2,2]]
Output: 3
Explanation: There are 3 equal row and column pairs:
- (Row 0, Column 0): [3,1,2,2]
- (Row 2, Column 2): [2,4,2,2]
- (Row 3, Column 2): [2,4,2,2]
 

## Explanation

The solution employs two main steps:

Transpose the matrix: This is achieved using the zip function along with unpacking the original grid matrix. By doing this, we obtain a transposed version of the original grid, where rows are now columns and vice versa. 

Count the equal pairs: We can now iterate over each row of the original grid and for each row, iterate over each row of the transposed grid (g). Whenever we find a row in the original grid matches a row in g, it means that the original row and the corresponding column of the original grid form an equal pair. We sum up all such instances to get the final result.

## Algorithm

TBD


## Solution in cpp
```
class Solution {
public:
    int equalPairs(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        int n = grid.size();
        int ans = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
                int ok = 1;
                for (int k = 0; k < n; ++k) {
                    if (grid[i][k] != grid[k][j]) {
                        ok = 0;
                        break;
                    }
                }
                ans += ok;
            }
        }
        return ans;        
    }
};
```

## Solution in Python
```
class Solution:
  def equalPairs(self, grid: list[list[int]]) -> int:
    n = len(grid)
    ans = 0

    for i in range(n):
      for j in range(n):
        k = 0
        while k < n:
          if grid[i][k] != grid[k][j]:
            break
          k += 1
        if k == n:  # R[i] == C[j]
          ans += 1

    return ans
```
