# Question

Given a string  `s`, reverse only all the vowels in the string and return it.

The vowels are  `'a'`,  `'e'`,  `'i'`,  `'o'`, and  `'u'`, and they can appear in both lower and upper cases, more than once.


# Examples

    Example 1:
    Input: s = "hello"
    Output: "holle"
    
    Example 2:
    Input: s = "leetcode"
    Output: "leotcede"  
    

## Explanation

The solution is to use the two-pointer technique. One pointer (i) starts at the beginning of the string, while the other pointer (j) starts at the end. The pointers move towards each other, and when they each find a vowel, those vowels are swapped. The process continues until the two pointers meet or pass one another, which would mean all vowels have been considered.

## Algorithm

1. Take two pointers, one for starting and the other one at the end of string. 
2. while ( first <= end), check for the chars for vowels. 
3. If both are not vowels, increment first pointer and decrement last pointer. 
4. If one of them are vowels, increment/decrement the other one. 
5. If both are vowels, then swap the characters. 
8. Return the string.


## Solution in cpp
```
    class Solution {
    public:
        bool isVowel(char c) {
            if ((c == 'a') || (c == 'e') || (c == 'i') || (c == 'o') ||
                (c == 'u') || (c == 'A') || (c == 'E') || (c == 'I') ||
                (c == 'O') || (c == 'U'))
                return true;
            else
                return false;
        }
        string reverseVowels(string s) {
            int i = 0;
            int j = s.length();
    
            while (i <= j) {
                if (!isVowel(s[i]) && !isVowel(s[j])) {
                    i++;
                    j--;
                } else if (!isVowel(s[i]))
                    i++;
                else if (!isVowel(s[j]))
                    j--;
                 // If we reach here, both are vowels.
                else {
                    char tmp = s[j];
                    s[j] = s[i];
                    s[i] = tmp;
                    i++;
                    j--;
                }
            }
            return s;
        }
    };
```

## Solution in Python
```
class Solution:
  def reverseVowels(self, s: str) -> str:
    chars = list(s)
    kVowels = 'aeiouAEIOU'
    l = 0
    r = len(s) - 1

    while l < r:
      while l < r and chars[l] not in kVowels:
        l += 1
      while l < r and chars[r] not in kVowels:
        r -= 1
      chars[l], chars[r] = chars[r], chars[l]
      l += 1
      r -= 1

    return ''.join(chars)
