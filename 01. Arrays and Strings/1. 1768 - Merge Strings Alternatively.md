# Question

You are given two strings word1 and word2. Merge the strings by adding letters in alternating order, starting with word1. If a string is longer than the other, append the additional letters onto the end of the merged string.

Return the merged string.


# Examples

    Input: word1 = "abc", word2 = "pqr" Output: "apbqcr"
    
    Explanation: The merged string will be merged as so:
    
    word1:   a b c 
    word2:   p q r 
    merged:  a p b q c r

## Explanation

We traverse the two strings word1 and word2, take out the characters one by one, and append them to the result string.

## Algorithm

1. Determine the size of two strings.
2. Initialize a string variable to store result
3. loop through the two strings and each character to the output string. 
4. Return string. 

## Solution in cpp
```
    class  Solution {
    	public:
    	string  mergeAlternately(string  word1, string  word2) {
	    	// Obtain the size of two vectors.
    		int m = word1.size(), n = word2.size();
    		string ans;
    		int i = 0;
    		// Now loop through two strings, if we have a character in the string, add it to the output string.
    		while ( i < m || i < n) {
    			if (i < m) ans += word1[i];
    			if (i < n) ans += word2[i];
    			i++;
    		}
    		return ans;
    	}
    };
```

## Solution in Python
```
class Solution:
  def mergeAlternately(self, word1: str, word2: str) -> str:
    return ''.join(a + b for a, b in zip_longest(word1, word2, fillvalue=''))
```

Time Complexity: O(max(m+n)) -> We are iterating through two string lengths.

Space complexity: O(max(m+n)) -> We are creating a string that has both length strings.
